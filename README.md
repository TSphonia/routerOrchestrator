In order to run the orchestrator there are a few steps that need to be followed:

1. In POWDER, open up a VNC window.
2. Ensure python is downloaded (to run the .py file)
3. Within that window, use an xtern to download docker through these commands:
    git clone https://gitlab.flux.utah.edu/teach-studentview/cs4480-2025-s.git
    cd cs4480-2025-s/pa3/part1/
    ./dockersetup

4. Replace all files in ../part1/ with files from the tarball
5. Then use that xtern to run Zachary_Whipple_u0912714.py


Run it with -h argument to get a list of available commands.
Type exit or quit to close the program.
